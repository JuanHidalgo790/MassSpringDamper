# MassSpringDamper
Code to simulate the dynamics of a single mass attached to a spring and a damper subjected to an external forcing

## Problem

A block with mass $M$ is attached to a spring and a damper. Also, it is forced with a function $f(t)$.

The dynamic of this system is described as

$$m\ddot{x}+c\dot{x}+kx=f \sin{\omega t}$$
